Here is a **15-day DSA plan** that maps LeetCode problems to the core concepts behind *out-of-order execution* — dependency tracking, scheduling, and in-order commit.
You can treat each day as a micro-module in building your mental model of a CPU pipeline.

**Goal at the end:**
By Day 15, you’ll have solved 14 LeetCode problems that map directly to CPU scheduling logic and built a simplified *out-of-order execution simulator* as your final exercise.
